# Not Documented

This directory contains some more generalizations. Those were not
encontered during the optimization of `_getextrema()` but during
trying to apply the found method to other functions and libraries
(see chapter "6. Method Transferability" of the paper).

These were not described in the paper itself - as it would get too long.

There is a short Readme in each subdirectory expaining the
optimization in more detail, similar to the "Generalization of
Findings" chapter of the paper.
